This is a sample project for the Introduction to Activities tutorial. 

Things covered - 
 * Creating an activity
 * Starting another activity for result
 * Finishing an activity and passing result to caller activity
 * Lifecycle methods and states - onCreate(), onPause() and onResume()
 * Handling config changes 
 * Saving/ Persisting data

Things not covered in this project. Should I just mention them in the theory section or would you want a more complex project to explain it with an example?
 * Using onSaveInstanceState() and onRestoreInstanceState()
 * OnDestroy() - there was nothing to cleanup in this example. Is it too simple?
 * Using fragments to save state - maybe refer to Google's docs and Huyen's tutorial
